  Ingest documents into the Obsidian wiki by distilling their knowledge into interconnected wiki pages.
  Use this skill whenever the user wants to add new sources to their wiki, process a document or directory,
  import articles, papers, or notes into their knowledge base, or says things like "add this to the wiki",
  "process these docs", "ingest this folder". Also triggers when the user drops a file and wants it
  incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

# Obsidian Ingest — Document Distillation

You are ingesting source documents into an Obsidian wiki. Your job is not to summarize — it is to **distill and integrate** knowledge across the entire wiki.

## Before You Start

1. Read `.env` to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and `OBSIDIAN_SOURCES_DIR`
2. Read `.manifest.json` at the vault root to check what's already been ingested
3. Read `index.md` to understand current wiki content
4. Read `log.md` to understand recent activity

## Ingest Modes

This skill supports two modes. Ask the user or infer from context:

### Append Mode (default)
Only ingest sources that are **new or modified** since last ingest. Check the manifest:
- If a source path is not in `.manifest.json` → it's new, ingest it
- If a source path is in `.manifest.json` but its modification time on disk is newer than `ingested_at` → it's modified, re-ingest it
- If a source path is in `.manifest.json` and unchanged → skip it

This is the right choice most of the time. It's fast and doesn't duplicate work.

### Full Mode
Ingest everything regardless of manifest state. Use when:
- The user explicitly asks for a full ingest
- The manifest is missing or corrupted
- After a `wiki-rebuild` has cleared the vault

## The Ingest Process

### Step 1: Read the Source

Read the document(s) the user wants to ingest. In append mode, skip files the manifest says are already ingested and unchanged. Supported formats:
- Markdown (`.md`) — read directly
- Text (`.txt`) — read directly
- PDF (`.pdf`) — use the Read tool with page ranges
- Web clippings — markdown files from Obsidian Web Clipper

Note the source path — you'll need it for provenance tracking.

### Step 2: Extract Knowledge

From the source, identify:
- **Key concepts** that deserve their own page or belong on an existing one
- **Entities** (people, tools, projects, organizations) mentioned
- **Claims** that can be attributed to the source
- **Relationships** between concepts (what connects to what)
- **Open questions** the source raises but doesn't answer

### Step 3: Determine Project Scope

If the source belongs to a specific project:
- Place project-specific knowledge under `projects/<project-name>/<category>/`
- Place general knowledge in global category directories
- Create or update the project overview at `projects/<name>/<name>.md` (named after the project — never `_project.md`, as Obsidian uses filenames as graph node labels)

If the source is not project-specific, put everything in global categories.

### Step 4: Plan Updates

Before writing anything, plan which pages to update or create. Aim for 10-15 pages per ingest. For each:
- Does this page already exist? (Check `index.md` and use Glob to search `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`)
- If it exists, what new information does this source add?
- If it's new, which category does it belong in?
- What `[[wikilinks]]` should connect it to existing pages?

### Step 5: Write/Update Pages

For each page in your plan:

**If creating a new page:**
- Use the page template from the llm-wiki skill (frontmatter + sections)
- Place in the correct category directory
- Add `[[wikilinks]]` to at least 2-3 existing pages
- Include the source in the `sources` frontmatter field

**If updating an existing page:**
- Read the current page first
- Merge new information — don't just append
- Update the `updated` timestamp in frontmatter
- Add the new source to the `sources` list
- Resolve any contradictions between old and new information (note them if unresolvable)

### Step 6: Update Cross-References

After writing pages, check that wikilinks work in both directions. If page A links to page B, consider whether page B should also link back to page A.

### Step 7: Update Manifest and Special Files

**`.manifest.json`** — For each source file ingested, add or update its entry:
```json
{
  "ingested_at": "TIMESTAMP",
  "size_bytes": FILE_SIZE,
  "modified_at": FILE_MTIME,
  "source_type": "document",
  "project": "project-name-or-null",
  "pages_created": ["list/of/pages.md"],
  "pages_updated": ["list/of/pages.md"]
}
```
Also update `stats.total_sources_ingested` and `stats.total_pages`.

If the manifest doesn't exist yet, create it with `version: 1`.

**`index.md`** — Add entries for any new pages, update summaries for modified pages.

**`log.md`** — Append an entry:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] INGEST source="path/to/source" pages_updated=N pages_created=M mode=append|full
```

## Handling Multiple Sources

When ingesting a directory, process sources one at a time but maintain a running awareness of the full batch. Later sources may strengthen or contradict earlier ones — that's fine, just update pages as you go.

### Step 8: Rebuild Index (CRITICAL)

After all pages are written and manifest is updated, **you MUST run the index-rebuild skill** to ensure `index.md` is synchronized with actual vault contents:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:index-rebuild
```

This prevents desynchronization between the index and actual pages (the bug that caused index.md to show only 46 pages when 159 pages existed).

## Quality Checklist

After ingesting, verify:
- [ ] Every new page has frontmatter with title, category, tags, sources
- [ ] Every new page has at least 2 wikilinks to existing pages
- [ ] No orphaned pages (pages with zero incoming links)
- [ ] `.manifest.json` is updated with all pages created/modified
- [ ] `log.md` has the ingest entry
- [ ] Source attribution is present for every new claim
- [ ] **`index.md` has been rebuilt** using index-rebuild skill
